        <p>Here you can find some information about one of my favorite animes : Komi Can't Communicate</p>

        <p>It is a really good anime that is centered around a boy who was a social outcast in middle school.</p>
        <p>He then meats Komi who can not verbally communicate with others casually</p>
        <p>He helps her become more social and help her further her queset to 100 friends</p>
